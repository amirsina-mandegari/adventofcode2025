# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository! This repo contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 challenges, solved using Python. Each day has its own folder with the corresponding solution for that day's puzzle.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December, where a new coding puzzle is released each day. Each puzzle requires creative problem-solving and coding skills. The puzzles range in difficulty, and solutions are often written in a variety of programming languages.

The event begins on December 1st, with a new challenge each day leading up to Christmas Eve. It's a fun way to learn, practice programming, and get into the holiday spirit!

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is organized by day. Each day's challenge is contained within its own folder. The most important file in each folder is `solution.py`, which contains the solution code for that day's puzzle. Other files (such as `input` files) may be present depending on the requirements of each question.

```
adventofcode2025/
├── day01/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── input (optional, may vary by day)
├── day02/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── input (optional, may vary by day)
├── day03/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── input (optional, may vary by day)
└── ...
```

Each folder is named by the day of the challenge (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.), and each contains a Python file `solution.py` with the code that solves the problem for that day. Additional files may be included as needed for each specific puzzle.

## Usage

To view and run the solutions locally, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirsina-mandegari/adventofcode2025.git
cd adventofcode2025
```

Each day's solution is in a separate folder. You can navigate to the corresponding day's folder and run the solution. For example, for Day 1:

```bash
cd day01
python solution.py
```

The solutions are written in Python, so you will need Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Languages

All solutions in this repository are written in **Python**. If you want to use another language or modify the code for optimization, feel free to do so!

## Contributing

While this repository is intended to document my own solutions, feel free to fork it, suggest improvements, or share your own solutions to the Advent of Code challenges! If you want to contribute or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

If you'd like to contribute, please ensure that your code follows the same structure and style as the existing solutions.
